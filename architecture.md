# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM, FastAPI, and Streamlit

## Overview

This application predicts stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. It consists of a backend built with FastAPI and a frontend created using Streamlit. The application fetches historical stock data, processes it, and predicts future prices.

## How the Application Works

### Frontend Integration

The frontend of the application is built using Streamlit, a Python library that makes it easy to create and share custom web apps for machine learning and data science. 

- **User Input**: Users can select a stock ticker symbol from a predefined list using a dropdown menu.
- **Data Display**: Upon selecting a ticker and clicking the 'Predict' button, the application fetches the corresponding stock data.
- **Prediction**: The frontend sends a request to the backend API to perform the prediction. 
- **Visualization**: The predicted prices and actual prices are plotted and displayed using `matplotlib`.

### Backend Functionality

The backend is powered by FastAPI, a modern web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+.

- **Data Loading**: The application uses `yfinance` to fetch historical stock data.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Data is scaled using `MinMaxScaler` from `sklearn` to normalize the values before prediction.
- **Prediction**: The pre-trained LSTM model (`keras_model.h5`) is loaded, and the prediction is made on the preprocessed data.
- **API**: The backend exposes an API endpoint `/predict` that accepts a stock ticker symbol and returns predicted prices and actual prices for comparison.

## Why LSTM for Stock Price Prediction?

### Benefits of LSTM over Other Algorithms

1. **Sequential Data Handling**: LSTMs are specifically designed to handle sequential data, making them suitable for time-series forecasting tasks like stock price prediction.
2. **Long-Term Dependencies**: LSTMs can learn long-term dependencies, which is crucial for understanding trends and patterns in stock prices over time.
3. **Memory Cells**: The architecture of LSTMs includes memory cells that can maintain information for long periods, mitigating the vanishing gradient problem common in traditional RNNs.

### What is LSTM and How It Works?

**Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) capable of learning order dependence in sequence prediction problems. This capability is due to its unique architecture:

1. **Memory Cells**: LSTMs have memory cells that store information for long periods.
2. **Gates**: There are three types of gates within each LSTM cell:
   - **Forget Gate**: Decides what information to discard from the cell state.
   - **Input Gate**: Determines which values from the input to update the cell state.
   - **Output Gate**: Controls the output based on the cell state and the input.

These gates enable LSTMs to retain, update, and output relevant information for long sequences, making them effective for time-series prediction tasks.

## Docker Integration

The application can be containerized using Docker for consistent deployment across different environments.

### Dockerfile

The Dockerfile creates a virtual environment, installs dependencies, and runs the Streamlit application:

```dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.10-slim AS base

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Install virtualenv globally
RUN pip install virtualenv

# Create and activate a virtual environment
RUN virtualenv /venv
ENV PATH="/venv/bin:$PATH"

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install necessary dependencies
RUN pip install --upgrade pip
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Expose the port number on which Streamlit runs (default is 8501)
EXPOSE 8501

# Set environment variables for Streamlit
ENV LC_ALL=C.UTF-8
ENV LANG=C.UTF-8

# Run Streamlit using the specified command
CMD ["streamlit", "run", "app.py", "--server.port", "8501", "--server.address", "0.0.0.0"]
```

### Building and Running the Docker Image

1. **Build the Docker Image**:
    ```sh
    docker build -t stock-price-prediction-app .
    ```

2. **Run the Docker Container**:
    ```sh
    docker run -d -p 8501:8501 stock-price-prediction-app
    ```

## Running the Application Locally

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
    - On Windows:
      ```sh
      venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - On macOS and Linux:
      ```sh
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run the Application**:
    ```sh
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Conclusion
