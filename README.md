# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM, Streamlit, and FastAPI

This project is a stock price prediction application built using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks. It features a web interface created with Streamlit and an API backend powered by FastAPI. The application fetches historical stock data, preprocesses it, and makes future price predictions, visualizing the results.

## Features

- Fetches historical stock data from Yahoo Finance
- Preprocesses the data for use in an LSTM model
- Provides an API endpoint for making predictions
- Interactive web interface for selecting stocks and viewing predictions
- Visualizes actual vs predicted stock prices

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Deep learning framework for building and training the LSTM model
- **scikit-learn**: Data preprocessing (MinMaxScaler)
- **yfinance**: Fetching historical stock data
- **FastAPI**: Building the backend API
- **Pydantic**: Data validation
- **Streamlit**: Creating the web interface
- **Uvicorn**: ASGI server for running FastAPI
- **Docker**: Containerization

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Docker (for containerized deployment)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Stock-Price-Prediction-using-LSTM-Streamlit-FASTAPI.git
   cd Stock-Price-Prediction-using-LSTM-Streamlit-FASTAPI
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

### Using Docker

1. **Build the Docker image:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t stock-price-prediction-app .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker container:**
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 8501:8501 stock-price-prediction-app
   ```

## Usage

1. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8501`
2. Select a stock ticker symbol from the dropdown menu.
3. Click the "Predict" button to fetch data, make predictions, and visualize results.

## How it Works

### Data Loading

The application fetches historical stock data using the `yfinance` library. The data is then preprocessed, including scaling the closing prices using `MinMaxScaler` from `scikit-learn`.

### Model Prediction

The preprocessed data is fed into an LSTM model to make future stock price predictions. The LSTM model is designed to handle sequential data, making it well-suited for time series forecasting.

### Web Interface

The Streamlit interface allows users to select a stock ticker, fetch the historical data, and visualize both actual and predicted stock prices.

### API Endpoint

The FastAPI backend provides an endpoint (`/predict`) to handle prediction requests. The API takes a stock ticker symbol as input, fetches and preprocesses the data, makes predictions using the LSTM model, and returns the results.

## Benefits of LSTM

- **Handling Sequential Data:** LSTMs are designed to process and predict time series data by retaining long-term dependencies.
- **Memory Retention:** They can remember information over long periods, which is essential for accurate stock price prediction.
- **Flexibility:** LSTMs can model complex, non-linear relationships in the data, capturing trends that other algorithms might miss.
