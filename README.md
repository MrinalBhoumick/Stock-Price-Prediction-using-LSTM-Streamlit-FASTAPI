## Setup

### Creating a Virtual Environment

To set up the application in a virtual environment, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

<<<<<<< HEAD
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-price-prediction
    cd stock-price-prediction
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the FastAPI server:

    ```sh
    uvicorn app:app --reload
    ```

2. In a new terminal, run the Streamlit app:

    ```sh
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

### Docker Setup

To build and run the application using Docker:

1. Build the Docker image:

    ```sh
    docker build -t stock-price-prediction-app .
    ```

2. Run the Docker container:

    ```sh
    docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -p 8501:8501 stock-price-prediction-app
    ```

## Usage

1. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to access the Streamlit interface.
2. Select a stock ticker symbol from the dropdown menu and click "Predict" to see the predictions.

## How It Works

### LSTM Overview

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for sequence prediction problems. It can learn and remember over long sequences and is resistant to the vanishing gradient problem.

### Benefits of LSTM

- **Handles Long-Term Dependencies**: LSTMs can capture long-term dependencies in the data.
- **Resistant to Vanishing Gradient**: The architecture of LSTMs helps mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, making them suitable for long time series.

### Other Algorithms

While LSTMs are highly effective for time series prediction, other algorithms like ARIMA, Prophet, and simple feedforward neural networks can also be used. However, LSTMs generally provide better performance for complex patterns in time series data.
=======
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Docker (for containerized deployment)

   docker build -t stock-price-prediction-app .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker container:**
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 8501:8501 stock-price-prediction-app
   ```

## Usage

## How it Works

### Data Loading

The application fetches historical stock data using the `yfinance` library. The data is then preprocessed, including scaling the closing prices using `MinMaxScaler` from `scikit-learn`.

### Model Prediction

The preprocessed data is fed into an LSTM model to make future stock price predictions. The LSTM model is designed to handle sequential data, making it well-suited for time series forecasting.

### Web Interface

The Streamlit interface allows users to select a stock ticker, fetch the historical data, and visualize both actual and predicted stock prices.

### API Endpoint

The FastAPI backend provides an endpoint (`/predict`) to handle prediction requests. The API takes a stock ticker symbol as input, fetches and preprocesses the data, makes predictions using the LSTM model, and returns the results.

## Benefits of LSTM

- **Handling Sequential Data:** LSTMs are designed to process and predict time series data by retaining long-term dependencies.
- **Memory Retention:** They can remember information over long periods, which is essential for accurate stock price prediction.
- **Flexibility:** LSTMs can model complex, non-linear relationships in the data, capturing trends that other algorithms might miss.
